React card gallery task:

To start:

- to start page locally on your computer open terminal and npm install && npm run start

Things I spent most time on:

- the curve ui on the card (fixed with :: before elements with a shadow) and automatising the color asignments to each card so that what works in grid view doesn't break list view.
- sorting cards ascending/descending and rerendering them without triggering a new fetch request.

Used:
-useContext for state management
